        <h1>Mount Rushmore</h1>
        <p>
            Mount Rushmore is 1745 meters above sea level. That is equivalent to about 17 and a half football fields. This memorial attracts millions of people each year. Four years ago I went and saw Mount Rushmore and on the way out there is a building that tells you some of the history about it. Why should anyone care about it, well it is one of the few memorials that shows four important people that you should know about from our history. Today I am going to tell you about how Mount Rushmore got started, why they chose the presidents that they did, the workers, and how it was sculpted and carved.
        </p>
        <p>
            First, Mount Rushmore is a memorial that represents the first 150 years of history in the United States. It is located by Keystone, South Dakota as stated in an article in The (Adelaide). Doane Robinson first designed it in 1923. Robinson wanted a monument so big that it would put South Dakota on the Map. After the final decision of putting the faces of Washington, Lincoln, Jefferson, and Roosevelt, Gutzon Borglum, who was the sculptor, went looking for a place in South Dakota to put it. According to ohranger.com “Making Mount Rushmore,” On August 13, 1925 Borglum found Mt. Rushmore which he exclaimed, ”Here is the place! American history shall march along that skyline.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Before anyone could start sculpting they had to decide what they were going to sculpt. In the beginning it was going to be a giant Christopher Columbus. Borglum liked the idea of four presidents. As stated in archive.org "Mt. Rushmore presidents on the rock", when making the memorial these four presidents were not just drawn out of a hat they were picked for a reason. Washington was chosen because he was the first president and "the father of our country". Jefferson was chosen because he gave the nation a plan for freedom by drafting the Declaration of Independence. Lincoln was chosen because it was Borglum favorite president. Lastly, Roosevelt was chosen because Borglum believed that the vision that Roosevelt has of America's role in the world community should count to have him on the monument.
        </p>
        <p>
            There were many people that helped sculpt Mount Rushmore. In fact there was about 400 local men and women that helped. They had different jobs that they did such as callboy, driller, blacksmith, housekeepers, and many more. For all or most of the 400 workers they would have to climb up 700 stairs to clock in.  Then they were brought down to the "bosun chair" by a 3/8-inch thick steel cable, which was in front of the 500-foot states nps.gov “Carving History”.
        </p>
        <p>
            It took 14 years to carve Mount Rushmore. Borglum first started carving into the mountain in the year 1927 and did not finish until 1941. This is a long time, but if you think about it, each head was about 18 meters wide, so the time seems reasonable. 90% of the carving was done by dynamite as said in “Carving History”. In the process of carving, as stated in the same article above, in the final step after honeycombing, which was when the drillers and assistant carvers would drill holes into the granite very close together, workers would use the bumper tool to even up granite so it was like the surface of a smooth sidewalk. “Mount Rushmore presidents on the rock” says “Carving stopped in October 1941, on the eve of our entry into World War II”.
        </p>
        <p>
            To conclude, Mount Rushmore is a super size scale of four important presidents. It shows the first 150 years of history for the United States. Now that you have been told the history about how Mount Rushmore got started, why they chose the presidents that they did, the workers, and how it was sculpted and carved, you can answer any basic questions about it if asked.
